Hey Everybody

And I wonder, wonder now
And I wonder, wonder now
Everybody won`t you help me sing it one more time
So that everyone can hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Hey everybody if we`re gonna take a stand
Now let the world hear you now while clapping your hands
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
Let the world hear you now but stopping your feet
I say hey
Na ...
Let`s celebrate here
Let me hear you stop your feet one more time
Na...
Hey everybody, Hey everybody
